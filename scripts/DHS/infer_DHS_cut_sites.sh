################### infer_DHS_cut_sites.sh ###################
# This workflow will infer the Dnase I cut site based on the reads location

# INPUT:

# 1: The filtered DnaseI-seq bam file
# example: GM12878_final.bam

# 2: Output directory
# example: ./test

# 3: Blacklisted regions
# example: hg38.composite.blacklist.bed

# OUTPUT:

# Inferred Dnase I cut sites
# These sites are single base pair resolved Dnase I cut sites based on the 5' end of the read
###########################################################

### Rename Input Variables ###
bam=${1}
output_directory=${2}
blacklist=${3}

### Build names ###
cut_sites=`basename ${bam} .bam`_DHS_IS.bed.gz

# Make directory and change into it
mkdir -p ${output_directory}
cd ${output_directory}

### Process ###

# Convert bam to bed and then infer 1 bp resolved insertion sites. 
# I use pigz at the end of the command to compress the file since they can be very large.
# The 5' end is on the left side (+) strand.
# The 5' end is on the right side (-) strand.

# Because BED intervals are 0-based, half-open coordinate systems we want to have atleast 1 base where the interval covers so we add 1 bp to the end position.
# For the (+) strand add 1 bp (+ 1) for the end position.
# For the (-) strand add 1 bp (+ 1) for the end position.
